# Minor-project

Developed a sorting/searching visualiser using using HTML, CSS and JavaScript<br/>
Provides a graphical representation of sorting and searching algorithms in action, allowing users to see how the
algorithms operate.<br/>
Proficiently implemented a range of sorting and searching algorithms, including linear search, binary search, bubble
sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, and merge sort.


To run on your system:-<br/>
1)Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.<br/>
2)Navigate to the project directory.<br/>
3)Open the index.html file in your web browser.<br/>
4)Once the page loads, you will see a menu on the right top side of the screen with options to select different algorithms and customize the visualization.<br/>
5)Customize the settings as needed and select the desired algorithm.<br/>
6)Click the "Generate Random Array" button to generate a new array of random integers to sort or search.<br/>
7)Click the "Sort" or "Search" button to begin change between searching and sorting.<br/>
8)Watch the visualization as it runs, and see the changes to the array in real-time.<br/>
9)Repeat steps 5-8 as needed to try different algorithms and array sizes.<br/>


Note: Since this project only uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can simply open the index.html file directly in your web browser to run the project. No additional installation or setup is required.
